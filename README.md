# Django Marketplace Project
The Django Marketplace project is a web application built using Django, a popular Python web framework. The primary goal of this project is to create an online marketplace where users can buy and sell items. The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform various actions, such as adding, deleting, and editing items, registering and logging in, searching for items, and viewing detailed information about specific items.

# Key Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts by registering with their email and password. Once registered, they can securely log in to the application to access personalized features.

Item Management: Registered users have the ability to add new items to the marketplace, edit existing items, and remove items they no longer wish to sell. This feature empowers users to control their listings and keep their store up-to-date.

Search Functionality: The application incorporates a powerful search feature that allows users to find items based on various criteria such as item name, category, price range, and more. This helps users easily discover the items they are interested in.

Item Details Page: When users click on a specific item from the search results or the listings page, they are directed to the item details page. Here, they can view comprehensive information about the item, including its description, price, seller details, and more.

Django Admin Panel: The application provides access to the Django admin panel, which is a built-in feature of Django. The admin panel is primarily designed for site administrators to manage the backend of the application. From the admin panel, administrators can perform various administrative tasks, such as managing user accounts, verifying and moderating listings, and handling other crucial aspects of the application.
